## [View all business logic vulnerabilities labs](https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-labs#business-logic-vulnerabilities)

In this section, we'll introduce the concept of business logic vulnerabilities and explain how they can arise due to flawed assumptions about user behavior. We'll discuss the potential impact of logic flaws and teach you how they can be exploited. You can also practice what you've learned using our interactive labs, which are based on real bugs that we've encountered in the wild. Finally, we'll provide some general best practices to help you prevent these kinds of logic flaws arising in your own applications.

## What are business logic vulnerabilities?

Business logic vulnerabilities are flaws in the design and implementation of an application that allow an attacker to elicit unintended behavior. This potentially enables attackers to manipulate legitimate functionality to achieve a malicious goal. These flaws are generally the result of failing to anticipate unusual application states that may occur and, consequently, failing to handle them safely.
Note

```In this context, the term "business logic" simply refers to the set of rules that define how the application operates. As these rules aren't always directly related to a business, the associated vulnerabilities are also known as "application logic vulnerabilities" or simply "logic flaws".```

Logic flaws are often invisible to people who aren't explicitly looking for them as they typically won't be exposed by normal use of the application. However, an attacker may be able to exploit behavioral quirks by interacting with the application in ways that developers never intended.

One of the main purposes of business logic is to enforce the rules and constraints that were defined when designing the application or functionality. Broadly speaking, the business rules dictate how the application should react when a given scenario occurs. This includes preventing users from doing things that will have a negative impact on the business or that simply don't make sense.

Flaws in the logic can allow attackers to circumvent these rules. For example, they might be able to complete a transaction without going through the intended purchase workflow. In other cases, broken or non-existent validation of user-supplied data might allow users to make arbitrary changes to transaction-critical values or submit nonsensical input. By passing unexpected values into server-side logic, an attacker can potentially induce the application to do something that it isn't supposed to.

Logic-based vulnerabilities can be extremely diverse and are often unique to the application and its specific functionality. Identifying them often requires a certain amount of human knowledge, such as an understanding of the business domain or what goals an attacker might have in a given context. This makes them difficult to detect using automated vulnerability scanners. As a result, logic flaws are a great target for bug bounty hunters and manual testers in general.

## How do business logic vulnerabilities arise?

Business logic vulnerabilities often arise because the design and development teams make flawed assumptions about how users will interact with the application. These bad assumptions can lead to inadequate validation of user input. For example, if the developers assume that users will pass data exclusively via a web browser, the application may rely entirely on weak client-side controls to validate input. These are easily bypassed by an attacker using an intercepting proxy.

Ultimately, this means that when an attacker deviates from the expected user behavior, the application fails to take appropriate steps to prevent this and, subsequently, fails to handle the situation safely.

Logic flaws are particularly common in overly complicated systems that even the development team themselves do not fully understand. To avoid logic flaws, developers need to understand the application as a whole. This includes being aware of how different functions can be combined in unexpected ways. Developers working on large code bases may not have an intimate understanding of how all areas of the application work. Someone working on one component could make flawed assumptions about how another component works and, as a result, inadvertently introduce serious logic flaws. If the developers do not explicitly document any assumptions that are being made, it is easy for these kinds of vulnerabilities to creep into an application.
What is the impact of business logic vulnerabilities?

The impact of business logic vulnerabilities can, at times, be fairly trivial. It is a broad category and the impact is highly variable. However, any unintended behavior can potentially lead to high-severity attacks if an attacker is able to manipulate the application in the right way. For this reason, quirky logic should ideally be fixed even if you can't work out how to exploit it yourself. There is always a risk that someone else will be able to.

Fundamentally, the impact of any logic flaw depends on what functionality it is related to. If the flaw is in the authentication mechanism, for example, this could have a serious impact on your overall security. Attackers could potentially exploit this for privilege escalation, or to bypass authentication entirely, gaining access to sensitive data and functionality. This also exposes an increased attack surface for other exploits.

Flawed logic in financial transactions can obviously lead to massive losses for the business through stolen funds, fraud, and so on.

You should also note that even though logic flaws may not allow an attacker to benefit directly, they could still allow a malicious party to damage the business in some way.

## What are some examples of business logic vulnerabilities?
The best way to understand business logic vulnerabilities is to look at real-world cases and learn from the mistakes that were made. We've provided concrete examples of a variety of common logic flaws, as well as some deliberately vulnerable websites so that you can practice exploiting these vulnerabilities yourself. 

 Business logic vulnerabilities are relatively specific to the context in which they occur. However, although individual instances of logic flaws differ hugely, they can share many common themes. In particular, they can be loosely grouped based on the initial mistakes that introduced the vulnerability in the first place.

In this section, we'll look at examples of some typical mistakes that design and development teams make and show you how they can directly lead to business logic flaws. Whether you're developing your own applications, or auditing existing ones, you can take the lessons learned from these examples and apply the same critical thinking to other applications that you encounter.

Examples of logic flaws include:
- Excessive trust in client-side controls LABS
- Failing to handle unconventional input LABS
- Making flawed assumptions about user behavior LABS
- Domain-specific flaws LABS
- Providing an encryption oracle LABS
- Email address parser discrepancies LABS

### Excessive trust in client-side controls
A fundamentally flawed assumption is that users will only interact with the application via the provided web interface. This is especially dangerous because it leads to the further assumption that client-side validation will prevent users from supplying malicious input. However, an attacker can simply use tools such as Burp Proxy to tamper with the data after it has been sent by the browser but before it is passed into the server-side logic. This effectively renders the client-side controls useless.

Accepting data at face value, without performing proper integrity checks and server-side validation, can allow an attacker to do all kinds of damage with relatively minimal effort. Exactly what they are able to achieve is dependent on the functionality and what it is doing with the controllable data. In the right context, this kind of flaw can have devastating consequences for both business-related functionality and the security of the website itself. 

**Example**. [Lab: Excessive trust in client-side controls](https://portswigger.net/web-security/logic-flaws/examples/lab-logic-flaws-excessive-trust-in-client-side-controls)

This lab doesn't adequately validate user input. You can exploit a logic flaw in its purchasing workflow to buy items for an unintended price. To solve the lab, buy a "Lightweight l33t leather jacket".
You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter.

**Answer**.

1. With Burp running, log in and attempt to buy the leather jacket. The order is rejected because you don't have enough store credit.
2. In Burp, go to "Proxy" > "HTTP history" and study the order process. Notice that when you add an item to your cart, the corresponding request contains a price parameter. Send the POST /cart request to Burp Repeater.
3. In Burp Repeater, change the price to an arbitrary integer and send the request. Refresh the cart and confirm that the price has changed based on your input.
4. Repeat this process to set the price to any amount less than your available store credit.
5. Complete the order to solve the lab.


**Example**. [Lab: 2FA broken logic](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/multi-factor/lab-2fa-broken-logic)

This lab's two-factor authentication is vulnerable due to its flawed logic. To solve the lab, access Carlos's account page. 
Your credentials: `wiener:peter`. Victim's username: `carlos`.
You also have access to the email server to receive your 2FA verification code. 

**Answer**.

1. With Burp running, log in to your own account and investigate the 2FA verification process. Notice that in the POST /login2 request, the verify parameter is used to determine which user's account is being accessed.
2. Log out of your account.
3. Send the GET /login2 request to Burp Repeater. Change the value of the verify parameter to carlos and send the request. This ensures that a temporary 2FA code is generated for Carlos.
4. Go to the login page and enter your username and password. Then, submit an invalid 2FA code.
5. Send the POST /login2 request to Burp Intruder.
6. In Burp Intruder, set the verify parameter to carlos and add a payload position to the mfa-code parameter. Brute-force the verification code.
7. Load the 302 response in the browser.
8. Click My account to solve the lab.

### Failing to handle unconventional input

 One aim of the application logic is to restrict user input to values that adhere to the business rules. For example, the application may be designed to accept arbitrary values of a certain data type, but the logic determines whether or not this value is acceptable from the perspective of the business. Many applications incorporate numeric limits into their logic. This might include limits designed to manage inventory, apply budgetary restrictions, trigger phases of the supply chain, and so on.

Let's take the simple example of an online shop. When ordering products, users typically specify the quantity that they want to order. Although any integer is theoretically a valid input, the business logic might prevent users from ordering more units than are currently in stock, for example.

To implement rules like this, developers need to anticipate all possible scenarios and incorporate ways to handle them into the application logic. In other words, they need to tell the application whether it should allow a given input and how it should react based on various conditions. If there is no explicit logic for handling a given case, this can lead to unexpected and potentially exploitable behavior.

For example, a numeric data type might accept negative values. Depending on the related functionality, it may not make sense for the business logic to allow this. However, if the application doesn't perform adequate server-side validation and reject this input, an attacker may be able to pass in a negative value and induce unwanted behavior.

Consider a funds transfer between two bank accounts. This functionality will almost certainly check whether the sender has sufficient funds before completing the transfer:

    $transferAmount = $_POST['amount'];
    $currentBalance = $user->getBalance();
    
    if ($transferAmount <= $currentBalance) {
        // Complete the transfer
    } else {
        // Block the transfer: insufficient funds
    }

But if the logic doesn't sufficiently prevent users from supplying a negative value in the amount parameter, this could be exploited by an attacker to both bypass the balance check and transfer funds in the "wrong" direction. If the attacker sent -$1000 to the victim's account, this might result in them receiving $1000 from the victim instead. The logic would always evaluate that -1000 is less than the current balance and approve the transfer.

Simple logic flaws like this can be devastating if they occur in the right functionality. They are also easy to miss during both development and testing, especially given that such inputs may be blocked by client-side controls on the web interface.

When auditing an application, you should use tools such as Burp Proxy and Repeater to try submitting unconventional values. In particular, try input in ranges that legitimate users are unlikely to ever enter. This includes exceptionally high or exceptionally low numeric inputs and abnormally long strings for text-based fields. You can even try unexpected data types. By observing the application's response, you should try and answer the following questions:
- Are there any limits that are imposed on the data?
- What happens when you reach those limits?
- Is any transformation or normalization being performed on your input?

This may expose weak input validation that allows you to manipulate the application in unusual ways. Keep in mind that if you find one form on the target website that fails to safely handle unconventional input, it's likely that other forms will have the same issues. 

**Example**. [Lab: High-level logic vulnerability](https://portswigger.net/web-security/logic-flaws/examples/lab-logic-flaws-high-level)

This lab doesn't adequately validate user input. You can exploit a logic flaw in its purchasing workflow to buy items for an unintended price. To solve the lab, buy a "Lightweight l33t leather jacket".
You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter 

**Answer**.

1. With Burp running, log in and add a cheap item to your cart.
2. In Burp, go to "Proxy" > "HTTP history" and study the corresponding HTTP messages. Notice that the quantity is determined by a parameter in the POST /cart request.
3. Go to the "Intercept" tab and turn on interception. Add another item to your cart and go to the intercepted POST /cart request in Burp.
4. Change the quantity parameter to an arbitrary integer, then forward any remaining requests. Observe that the quantity in the cart was successfully updated based on your input.
5. Repeat this process, but request a negative quantity this time. Check that this is successfully deducted from the cart quantity.
6. Request a suitable negative quantity to remove more units from the cart than it currently contains. Confirm that you have successfully forced the cart to contain a negative quantity of the product. Go to your cart and notice that the total price is now also a negative amount.
7. Add the leather jacket to your cart as normal. Add a suitable negative quantity of the another item to reduce the total price to less than your remaining store credit.
8. Place the order to solve the lab.

**Example**. [Lab: Low-level logic flaw](https://portswigger.net/web-security/logic-flaws/examples/lab-logic-flaws-low-level)

This lab doesn't adequately validate user input. You can exploit a logic flaw in its purchasing workflow to buy items for an unintended price. To solve the lab, buy a "Lightweight l33t leather jacket".
You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter.

Hint. You will need to use Burp Intruder (or Turbo Intruder) to solve this lab.
To make sure the price increases in predictable increments, we recommend configuring your attack to only send one request at a time. In Burp Intruder, you can do this from the resource pool settings using the Maximum concurrent requests option. 

**Answer**.

1. With Burp running, log in and attempt to buy the leather jacket. The order is rejected because you don't have enough store credit. In the proxy history, study the order process. Send the POST /cart request to Burp Repeater.
2. In Burp Repeater, notice that you can only add a 2-digit quantity with each request. Send the request to Burp Intruder.
3. Go to Intruder and set the quantity parameter to 99.
4. In the Payloads side panel, select the payload type Null payloads. Under Payload configuration, select Continue indefinitely. Start the attack.
5. While the attack is running, go to your cart. Keep refreshing the page every so often and monitor the total price. Eventually, notice that the price suddenly switches to a large negative integer and starts counting up towards 0. The price has exceeded the maximum value permitted for an integer in the back-end programming language (2,147,483,647). As a result, the value has looped back around to the minimum possible value (-2,147,483,648).
6. Clear your cart. In the next few steps, we'll try to add enough units so that the price loops back around and settles between $0 and the $100 of your remaining store credit. This is not mathematically possible using only the leather jacket. Note that the price of the jacket is stored in cents (133700).
7. Create the same Intruder attack again, but this time under Payload configuration, choose to generate exactly 323 payloads.
8. Click Resource pool to open the Resource pool tab. Add the attack to a resource pool with the Maximum concurrent requests set to 1. Start the attack.
9. When the Intruder attack finishes, go to the POST /cart request in Burp Repeater and send a single request for 47 jackets. The total price of the order should now be -$1221.96.
10. Use Burp Repeater to add a suitable quantity of another item to your cart so that the total falls between $0 and $100.
11. Place the order to solve the lab.

**Example**. [Lab: Inconsistent handling of exceptional input](https://portswigger.net/web-security/logic-flaws/examples/lab-logic-flaws-inconsistent-handling-of-exceptional-input)

This lab doesn't adequately validate user input. You can exploit a logic flaw in its account registration process to gain access to administrative functionality. To solve the lab, access the admin panel and delete the user carlos. 

Hint. You can use the link in the lab banner to access an email client connected to your own private mail server. The client will display all messages sent to @YOUR-EMAIL-ID.web-security-academy.net and any arbitrary subdomains. Your unique email ID is displayed in the email client. 

**Answer**.

1. While proxying traffic through Burp, open the lab and go to the "Target" > "Site map" tab. Right-click on the lab domain and select "Engagement tools" > "Discover content" to open the content discovery tool.
2. Click "Session is not running" to start the content discovery. After a short while, look at the "Site map" tab in the dialog. Notice that it discovered the path `/admin`.
3. Try to browse to `/admin`. Although you don't have access, an error message indicates that `DontWannaCry` users do.
4. Go to the account registration page. Notice the message telling DontWannaCry employees to use their company email address.
5. From the button in the lab banner, open the email client. Make a note of the unique ID in the domain name for your email server (`@YOUR-EMAIL-ID.web-security-academy.net`).
6. Go back to the lab and register with an exceptionally long email address in the format: `very-long-string@YOUR-EMAIL-ID.web-security-academy.net`. The `very-long-string` should be at least 200 characters long.
7. Go to the email client and notice that you have received a confirmation email. Click the link to complete the registration process.
8. Log in and go to the "My account" page. Notice that your email address has been truncated to 255 characters.
9. Log out and go back to the account registration page.
10. Register a new account with another long email address, but this time include `dontwannacry.com` as a subdomain in your email address as follows: `very-long-string@dontwannacry.com.YOUR-EMAIL-ID.web-security-academy.net`
Make sure that the `very-long-string` is the right number of characters so that the "m" at the end of `@dontwannacry.com` is character 255 exactly. something like `attackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattack@dontwannacry.com`
11. Go to the email client and click the link in the confirmation email that you have received. Log in to your new account and notice that you now have access to the admin panel. The confirmation email was successfully sent to your email client, but the application server truncated the address associated with your account to 255 characters. As a result, you have been able to register with what appears to be a valid `@dontwannacry.com` address. You can confirm this from the "My account" page.
12. Go to the admin panel and delete `carlos` to solve the lab.

### Making flawed assumptions about user behavior
One of the most common root causes of logic vulnerabilities is making flawed assumptions about user behavior. This can lead to a wide range of issues where developers have not considered potentially dangerous scenarios that violate these assumptions. In this section, we'll provide some cautionary examples of common assumptions that should be avoided and demonstrate how they can lead to dangerous logic flaws.

#### Trusted users won't always remain trustworthy

Applications may appear to be secure because they implement seemingly robust measures to enforce the business rules. Unfortunately, some applications make the mistake of assuming that, having passed these strict controls initially, the user and their data can be trusted indefinitely. This can result in relatively lax enforcement of the same controls from that point on.

If business rules and security measures are not applied consistently throughout the application, this can lead to potentially dangerous loopholes that may be exploited by an attacker. 

**Example**. [Lab: Inconsistent security controls](https://portswigger.net/web-security/logic-flaws/examples/lab-logic-flaws-inconsistent-security-controls)

This lab's flawed logic allows arbitrary users to access administrative functionality that should only be available to company employees. To solve the lab, access the admin panel and delete the user carlos. 

**Answer**.

1. Open the lab then go to the "Target" > "Site map" tab in Burp. Right-click on the lab domain and select "Engagement tools" > "Discover content" to open the content discovery tool.
2. Click "Session is not running" to start the content discovery. After a short while, look at the "Site map" tab in the dialog. Notice that it discovered the path /admin.
3. Try and browse to /admin. Although you don't have access, the error message indicates that DontWannaCry users do.

4. Go to the account registration page. Notice the message telling DontWannaCry employees to use their company email address. Register with an arbitrary email address in the format:
5. anything@your-email-id.web-security-academy.net

6. You can find your email domain name by clicking the "Email client" button.
7. Go to the email client and click the link in the confirmation email to complete the registration.
8. Log in using your new account and go to the "My account" page. Notice that you have the option to change your email address. Change your email address to an arbitrary @dontwannacry.com address.
9. Notice that you now have access to the admin panel, where you can delete carlos to solve the lab.

#### Users won't always supply mandatory input

One misconception is that users will always supply values for mandatory input fields. Browsers may prevent ordinary users from submitting a form without a required input, but as we know, attackers can tamper with parameters in transit. This even extends to removing parameters entirely.

This is a particular issue in cases where multiple functions are implemented within the same server-side script. In this case, the presence or absence of a particular parameter may determine which code is executed. Removing parameter values may allow an attacker to access code paths that are supposed to be out of reach.

When probing for logic flaws, you should try removing each parameter in turn and observing what effect this has on the response. You should make sure to:

- Only remove one parameter at a time to ensure all relevant code paths are reached.
- Try deleting the name of the parameter as well as the value. The server will typically handle both cases differently.
- Follow multi-stage processes through to completion. Sometimes tampering with a parameter in one step will have an effect on another step further along in the workflow.

This applies to both URL and POST parameters, but don't forget to check the cookies too. This simple process can reveal some bizarre application behavior that may be exploitable. 

**Example**. [Lab: Weak isolation on dual-use endpoint](https://portswigger.net/web-security/logic-flaws/examples/lab-logic-flaws-weak-isolation-on-dual-use-endpoint)

This lab makes a flawed assumption about the user's privilege level based on their input. As a result, you can exploit the logic of its account management features to gain access to arbitrary users' accounts. To solve the lab, access the administrator account and delete the user carlos.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter 

**Answer**.

1. With Burp running, log in and access your account page.
2. Change your password.
3. Study the POST /my-account/change-password request in Burp Repeater.
4. Notice that if you remove the current-password parameter entirely, you are able to successfully change your password without providing your current one.
5. Observe that the user whose password is changed is determined by the username parameter. Set username=administrator and send the request again.
6. Log out and notice that you can now successfully log in as the administrator using the password you just set.
7. Go to the admin panel and delete carlos to solve the lab.

**Example**. [Lab: Password reset broken logic](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/other-mechanisms/lab-password-reset-broken-logic)

This lab's password reset functionality is vulnerable. To solve the lab, reset Carlos's password then log in and access his "My account" page.

- Your credentials: wiener:peter
- Victim's username: carlos

**Answer**.

Notice: without removing temp-forgot-password-token and just changing the username to carlos.
1. With Burp running, click the Forgot your password? link and enter your own username.
2. Click the Email client button to view the password reset email that was sent. Click the link in the email and reset your password to whatever you want.
3. In Burp, go to Proxy > HTTP history and study the requests and responses for the password reset functionality. Observe that the reset token is provided as a URL query parameter in the reset email. Notice that when you submit your new password, the POST /forgot-password?temp-forgot-password-token request contains the username as hidden input. Send this request to Burp Repeater.
4. In Burp Repeater, observe that the password reset functionality still works even if you delete the value of the temp-forgot-password-token parameter in both the URL and request body. This confirms that the token is not being checked when you submit the new password.
5. In the browser, request a new password reset and change your password again. Send the POST /forgot-password?temp-forgot-password-token request to Burp Repeater again.
6. In Burp Repeater, delete the value of the temp-forgot-password-token parameter in both the URL and request body. Change the username parameter to carlos. Set the new password to whatever you want and send the request.
7. In the browser, log in to Carlos's account using the new password you just set. Click My account to solve the lab.

#### Users won't always follow the intended sequence

Many transactions rely on predefined workflows consisting of a sequence of steps. The web interface will typically guide users through this process, taking them to the next step of the workflow each time they complete the current one. However, attackers won't necessarily adhere to this intended sequence. Failing to account for this possibility can lead to dangerous flaws that may be relatively simple to exploit.

For example, many websites that implement two-factor authentication (2FA) require users to log in on one page before entering a verification code on a separate page. Assuming that users will always follow this process through to completion and, as a result, not verifying that they do, may allow attackers to bypass the 2FA step entirely. 

**Example**. [Lab: 2FA simple bypass](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/multi-factor/lab-2fa-simple-bypass)

This lab's two-factor authentication can be bypassed. You have already obtained a valid username and password, but do not have access to the user's 2FA verification code. To solve the lab, access Carlos's account page.
- Your credentials: wiener:peter
- Victim's credentials carlos:montoya

**Answer**.

1. Log in to your own account. Your 2FA verification code will be sent to you by email. Click the Email client button to access your emails.
2. Go to your account page and make a note of the URL.
3. Log out of your account.
4. Log in using the victim's credentials.
5. When prompted for the verification code, manually change the URL to navigate to /my-account. The lab is solved when the page loads.

Making assumptions about the sequence of events can lead to a wide range of issues even within the same workflow or functionality. Using tools like Burp Proxy and Repeater, once an attacker has seen a request, they can replay it at will and use forced browsing to perform any interactions with the server in any order they want. This allows them to complete different actions while the application is in an unexpected state.

To identify these kinds of flaws, you should use forced browsing to submit requests in an unintended sequence. For example, you might skip certain steps, access a single step more than once, return to earlier steps, and so on. Take note of how different steps are accessed. Although you often just submit a GET or POST request to a specific URL, sometimes you can access steps by submitting different sets of parameters to the same URL. As with all logic flaws, try to identify what assumptions the developers have made and where the attack surface lies. You can then look for ways of violating these assumptions.

Note that this kind of testing will often cause exceptions because expected variables have null or uninitialized values. Arriving at a location in a partly defined or inconsistent state is also likely to cause the application to complain. In this case, be sure to pay close attention to any error messages or debug information that you encounter. These can be a valuable source of information disclosure, which can help you fine-tune your attack and understand key details about the back-end behavior. 

**Example**. [Lab: Insufficient workflow validation](https://portswigger.net/web-security/logic-flaws/examples/lab-logic-flaws-insufficient-workflow-validation)

This lab makes flawed assumptions about the sequence of events in the purchasing workflow. To solve the lab, exploit this flaw to buy a "Lightweight l33t leather jacket".

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter 

**Answer**.

1. With Burp running, log in and buy any item that you can afford with your store credit.
2. Study the proxy history. Observe that when you place an order, the POST /cart/checkout request redirects you to an order confirmation page. Send GET /cart/order-confirmation?order-confirmation=true to Burp Repeater.
3. Add the leather jacket to your basket.
4. In Burp Repeater, resend the order confirmation request. Observe that the order is completed without the cost being deducted from your store credit and the lab is solved.

**Example**. [Lab: Authentication bypass via flawed state machine](https://portswigger.net/web-security/logic-flaws/examples/lab-logic-flaws-authentication-bypass-via-flawed-state-machine)

This lab makes flawed assumptions about the sequence of events in the login process. To solve the lab, exploit this flaw to bypass the lab's authentication, access the admin interface, and delete the user carlos.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter 

**Answer**.

1. With Burp running, complete the login process and notice that you need to select your role before you are taken to the home page.
2. Use the content discovery tool to identify the /admin path.
3. Try browsing to /admin directly from the role selection page and observe that this doesn't work.
4. Log out and then go back to the login page. In Burp, turn on proxy intercept then log in.
5. Forward the POST /login request. The next request is GET /role-selector. Drop this request and then browse to the lab's home page. Observe that your role has defaulted to the administrator role and you have access to the admin panel.
6. Delete carlos to solve the lab.

### Domain-specific flaws
In many cases, you will encounter logic flaws that are specific to the business domain or the purpose of the site.

The discounting functionality of online shops is a classic attack surface when hunting for logic flaws. This can be a potential gold mine for an attacker, with all kinds of basic logic flaws occurring in the way discounts are applied.

For example, consider an online shop that offers a 10% discount on orders over $1000. This could be vulnerable to abuse if the business logic fails to check whether the order was changed after the discount is applied. In this case, an attacker could simply add items to their cart until they hit the $1000 threshold, then remove the items they don't want before placing the order. They would then receive the discount on their order even though it no longer satisfies the intended criteria.

You should pay particular attention to any situation where prices or other sensitive values are adjusted based on criteria determined by user actions. Try to understand what algorithms the application uses to make these adjustments and at what point these adjustments are made. This often involves manipulating the application so that it is in a state where the applied adjustments do not correspond to the original criteria intended by the developers.

To identify these vulnerabilities, you need to think carefully about what objectives an attacker might have and try to find different ways of achieving this using the provided functionality. This may require a certain level of domain-specific knowledge in order to understand what might be advantageous in a given context. To use a simple example, you need to understand social media to understand the benefits of forcing a large number of users to follow you.

Without this knowledge of the domain, you may dismiss dangerous behavior because you simply aren't aware of its potential knock-on effects. Likewise, you may struggle to join the dots and notice how two functions can be combined in a harmful way. For simplicity, the examples used in this topic are specific to a domain that all users will already be familiar with, namely an online shop. However, whether you're bug bounty hunting, pentesting, or even just a developer trying to write more secure code, you may at some point encounter applications from less familiar domains. In this case, you should read as much documentation as possible and, where available, talk to subject-matter experts from the domain to get their insight. This may sound like a lot of work, but the more obscure the domain is, the more likely other testers will have missed plenty of bugs.

1. Log in and notice that there is a coupon code, NEWCUST5.
2. At the bottom of the page, sign up to the newsletter. You receive another coupon code, SIGNUP30.
3. Add the leather jacket to your cart.
4. Go to the checkout and apply both of the coupon codes to get a discount on your order.
5. Try applying the codes more than once. Notice that if you enter the same code twice in a row, it is rejected because the coupon has already been 6. applied. However, if you alternate between the two codes, you can bypass this control.
7. Reuse the two codes enough times to reduce your order total to less than your remaining store credit. Complete the order to solve the lab.

This solution uses Burp Intruder to automate the process of buying and redeeming gift cards. Users proficient in Python might prefer to use the Turbo Intruder extension instead.

1. With Burp running, log in and sign up for the newsletter to obtain a coupon code, `SIGNUP30`. Notice that you can buy $10 gift cards and redeem them from the My account page.
2. Add a gift card to your basket and proceed to the checkout. Apply the coupon code to get a 30% discount. Complete the order and copy the gift card code to your clipboard.
3. Go to your account page and redeem the gift card. Observe that this entire process has added $3 to your store credit. Now you need to try and automate this process.
4. Study the proxy history and notice that you redeem your gift card by supplying the code in the `gift-card` parameter of the `POST /gift-card` request.
5. Click Settings in the top toolbar. The Settings dialog opens.
6. Click Sessions. In the Session handling rules panel, click Add. The Session handling rule editor dialog opens.
7. In the dialog, go to the Scope tab. Under URL scope, select Include all URLs.
8. Go back to the Details tab. Under Rule actions, click Add > Run a macro. Under Select macro, click Add again to open the Macro Recorder.
9. Select the following sequence of requests:
```
  POST /cart
  POST /cart/coupon
  POST /cart/checkout
  GET /cart/order-confirmation?order-confirmed=true
  POST /gift-card
```
  Then, click OK. The Macro Editor opens.

10. In the list of requests, select `GET /cart/order-confirmation?order-confirmed=true`. Click Configure item. In the dialog that opens, click Add to create a custom parameter. Name the parameter gift-card and highlight the gift card code at the bottom of the response. Click OK twice to go back to the Macro Editor.
11. Select the POST /gift-card request and click Configure item again. In the Parameter handling section, use the drop-down menus to specify that the gift-card parameter should be derived from the prior response (response 4). Click OK.
12. In the Macro Editor, click Test macro. Look at the response to `GET /cart/order-confirmation?order-confirmation=true` and note the gift card code that was generated. Look at the `POST /gift-card` request. Make sure that the gift-card parameter matches and confirm that it received a `302` response. Keep clicking OK until you get back to the main Burp window.
13. Send the `GET /my-account` request to Burp Intruder. Make sure that Sniper attack is selected.
14. In the Payloads side panel, under Payload configuration, select the payload type Null payloads. Choose to generate 412 payloads.
15. Click on Resource pool to open the Resource pool side panel. Add the attack to a resource pool with the Maximum concurrent requests set to 1. Start the attack.
16. When the attack finishes, you will have enough store credit to buy the jacket and solve the lab.

### Providing an encryption oracle

Dangerous scenarios can occur when user-controllable input is encrypted and the resulting ciphertext is then made available to the user in some way. This kind of input is sometimes known as an "encryption oracle". An attacker can use this input to encrypt arbitrary data using the correct algorithm and asymmetric key.

This becomes dangerous when there are other user-controllable inputs in the application that expect data encrypted with the same algorithm. In this case, an attacker could potentially use the encryption oracle to generate valid, encrypted input and then pass it into other sensitive functions.

This issue can be compounded if there is another user-controllable input on the site that provides the reverse function. This would enable the attacker to decrypt other data to identify the expected structure. This saves them some of the work involved in creating their malicious data but is not necessarily required to craft a successful exploit.

The severity of an encryption oracle depends on what functionality also uses the same algorithm as the oracle. 

**Example**. [Lab: Authentication bypass via encryption oracle](https://portswigger.net/web-security/logic-flaws/examples/lab-logic-flaws-authentication-bypass-via-encryption-oracle)

This lab contains a logic flaw that exposes an encryption oracle to users. To solve the lab, exploit this flaw to gain access to the admin panel and delete the user carlos.

### Email address parser discrepancies

Some websites parse email addresses to extract the domain and determine which organization the email owner belongs to. While this process may initially seem straightforward, it is actually very complex, even for valid RFC-compliant addresses.

Discrepancies in how email addresses are parsed can undermine this logic. These discrepancies arise when different parts of the application handle email addresses differently.

An attacker can exploit these discrepancies using encoding techniques to disguise parts of the email address. This enables the attacker to create email addresses that pass initial validation checks but are interpreted differently by the server's parsing logic.

The main impact of email address parser discrepancies is unauthorized access. Attackers can register accounts using seemingly valid email addresses from restricted domains. This enables them to gain access to sensitive areas of the application, such as admin panels or restricted user functions.
More information

For detailed information on email parsing discrepancies, including how they can be exploited, see the [Splitting the Email Atom: Exploiting Parsers to Bypass Access Controls](https://portswigger.net/research/splitting-the-email-atom) whitepaper by Gareth Heyes of the PortSwigger Research team.

**Example**. [Lab: Bypassing access controls using email address parsing discrepancies](https://portswigger.net/web-security/logic-flaws/examples/lab-logic-flaws-bypassing-access-controls-using-email-address-parsing-discrepancies)

This lab validates email addresses to prevent attackers from registering addresses from unauthorized domains. There is a parser discrepancy in the validation logic and library used to parse email addresses.

To solve the lab, exploit this flaw to register an account and delete carlos.

## How to prevent business logic vulnerabilities

In short, the keys to preventing business logic vulnerabilities are to:
- Make sure developers and testers understand the domain that the application serves
- Avoid making implicit assumptions about user behavior or the behavior of other parts of the application

You should identify what assumptions you have made about the server-side state and implement the necessary logic to verify that these assumptions are met. This includes making sure that the value of any input is sensible before proceeding.

It is also important to make sure that both developers and testers are able to fully understand these assumptions and how the application is supposed to react in different scenarios. This can help the team to spot logic flaws as early as possible. To facilitate this, the development team should adhere to the following best practices wherever possible:
- Maintain clear design documents and data flows for all transactions and workflows, noting any assumptions that are made at each stage.
- Write code as clearly as possible. If it's difficult to understand what is supposed to happen, it will be difficult to spot any logic flaws. Ideally, well-written code shouldn't need documentation to understand it. In unavoidably complex cases, producing clear documentation is crucial to ensure that other developers and testers know what assumptions are being made and exactly what the expected behavior is.
- Note any references to other code that uses each component. Think about any side-effects of these dependencies if a malicious party were to manipulate them in an unusual way.

Due to the relatively unique nature of many logic flaws, it is easy to brush them off as a one-time mistake due to human error and move on. However, as we've demonstrated, these flaws are often the result of bad practices in the initial phases of building the application. Analyzing why a logic flaw existed in the first place, and how it was missed by the team, can help you to spot weaknesses in your processes. By making minor adjustments, you can increase the likelihood that similar flaws will be cut off at the source or caught earlier in the development process.
