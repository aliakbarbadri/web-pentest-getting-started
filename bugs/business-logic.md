## What are business logic vulnerabilities?

Business logic vulnerabilities are flaws in the design and implementation of an application that allow an attacker to elicit unintended behavior. This potentially enables attackers to manipulate legitimate functionality to achieve a malicious goal. These flaws are generally the result of failing to anticipate unusual application states that may occur and, consequently, failing to handle them safely.
Note

```In this context, the term "business logic" simply refers to the set of rules that define how the application operates. As these rules aren't always directly related to a business, the associated vulnerabilities are also known as "application logic vulnerabilities" or simply "logic flaws".```

Logic flaws are often invisible to people who aren't explicitly looking for them as they typically won't be exposed by normal use of the application. However, an attacker may be able to exploit behavioral quirks by interacting with the application in ways that developers never intended.

One of the main purposes of business logic is to enforce the rules and constraints that were defined when designing the application or functionality. Broadly speaking, the business rules dictate how the application should react when a given scenario occurs. This includes preventing users from doing things that will have a negative impact on the business or that simply don't make sense.

Flaws in the logic can allow attackers to circumvent these rules. For example, they might be able to complete a transaction without going through the intended purchase workflow. In other cases, broken or non-existent validation of user-supplied data might allow users to make arbitrary changes to transaction-critical values or submit nonsensical input. By passing unexpected values into server-side logic, an attacker can potentially induce the application to do something that it isn't supposed to.

Logic-based vulnerabilities can be extremely diverse and are often unique to the application and its specific functionality. Identifying them often requires a certain amount of human knowledge, such as an understanding of the business domain or what goals an attacker might have in a given context. This makes them difficult to detect using automated vulnerability scanners. As a result, logic flaws are a great target for bug bounty hunters and manual testers in general.

## How do business logic vulnerabilities arise?

Business logic vulnerabilities often arise because the design and development teams make flawed assumptions about how users will interact with the application. These bad assumptions can lead to inadequate validation of user input. For example, if the developers assume that users will pass data exclusively via a web browser, the application may rely entirely on weak client-side controls to validate input. These are easily bypassed by an attacker using an intercepting proxy.

Ultimately, this means that when an attacker deviates from the expected user behavior, the application fails to take appropriate steps to prevent this and, subsequently, fails to handle the situation safely.

Logic flaws are particularly common in overly complicated systems that even the development team themselves do not fully understand. To avoid logic flaws, developers need to understand the application as a whole. This includes being aware of how different functions can be combined in unexpected ways. Developers working on large code bases may not have an intimate understanding of how all areas of the application work. Someone working on one component could make flawed assumptions about how another component works and, as a result, inadvertently introduce serious logic flaws. If the developers do not explicitly document any assumptions that are being made, it is easy for these kinds of vulnerabilities to creep into an application.
What is the impact of business logic vulnerabilities?

The impact of business logic vulnerabilities can, at times, be fairly trivial. It is a broad category and the impact is highly variable. However, any unintended behavior can potentially lead to high-severity attacks if an attacker is able to manipulate the application in the right way. For this reason, quirky logic should ideally be fixed even if you can't work out how to exploit it yourself. There is always a risk that someone else will be able to.

Fundamentally, the impact of any logic flaw depends on what functionality it is related to. If the flaw is in the authentication mechanism, for example, this could have a serious impact on your overall security. Attackers could potentially exploit this for privilege escalation, or to bypass authentication entirely, gaining access to sensitive data and functionality. This also exposes an increased attack surface for other exploits.

Flawed logic in financial transactions can obviously lead to massive losses for the business through stolen funds, fraud, and so on.

You should also note that even though logic flaws may not allow an attacker to benefit directly, they could still allow a malicious party to damage the business in some way.

## What are some examples of business logic vulnerabilities?
The best way to understand business logic vulnerabilities is to look at real-world cases and learn from the mistakes that were made. We've provided concrete examples of a variety of common logic flaws, as well as some deliberately vulnerable websites so that you can practice exploiting these vulnerabilities yourself. 

 Business logic vulnerabilities are relatively specific to the context in which they occur. However, although individual instances of logic flaws differ hugely, they can share many common themes. In particular, they can be loosely grouped based on the initial mistakes that introduced the vulnerability in the first place.

In this section, we'll look at examples of some typical mistakes that design and development teams make and show you how they can directly lead to business logic flaws. Whether you're developing your own applications, or auditing existing ones, you can take the lessons learned from these examples and apply the same critical thinking to other applications that you encounter.

Examples of logic flaws include:
- Excessive trust in client-side controls LABS
- Failing to handle unconventional input LABS
- Making flawed assumptions about user behavior LABS
- Domain-specific flaws LABS
- Providing an encryption oracle LABS
- Email address parser discrepancies LABS

### Excessive trust in client-side controls
A fundamentally flawed assumption is that users will only interact with the application via the provided web interface. This is especially dangerous because it leads to the further assumption that client-side validation will prevent users from supplying malicious input. However, an attacker can simply use tools such as Burp Proxy to tamper with the data after it has been sent by the browser but before it is passed into the server-side logic. This effectively renders the client-side controls useless.

Accepting data at face value, without performing proper integrity checks and server-side validation, can allow an attacker to do all kinds of damage with relatively minimal effort. Exactly what they are able to achieve is dependent on the functionality and what it is doing with the controllable data. In the right context, this kind of flaw can have devastating consequences for both business-related functionality and the security of the website itself. 

**Example**. [Lab: Excessive trust in client-side controls](https://portswigger.net/web-security/logic-flaws/examples/lab-logic-flaws-excessive-trust-in-client-side-controls)

This lab doesn't adequately validate user input. You can exploit a logic flaw in its purchasing workflow to buy items for an unintended price. To solve the lab, buy a "Lightweight l33t leather jacket".
You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter.

**Answer**.

1. With Burp running, log in and attempt to buy the leather jacket. The order is rejected because you don't have enough store credit.
2. In Burp, go to "Proxy" > "HTTP history" and study the order process. Notice that when you add an item to your cart, the corresponding request contains a price parameter. Send the POST /cart request to Burp Repeater.
3. In Burp Repeater, change the price to an arbitrary integer and send the request. Refresh the cart and confirm that the price has changed based on your input.
4. Repeat this process to set the price to any amount less than your available store credit.
5. Complete the order to solve the lab.


**Example**. [Lab: 2FA broken logic](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/multi-factor/lab-2fa-broken-logic)

This lab's two-factor authentication is vulnerable due to its flawed logic. To solve the lab, access Carlos's account page. 
Your credentials: `wiener:peter`. Victim's username: `carlos`.
You also have access to the email server to receive your 2FA verification code. 

**Answer**.

1. With Burp running, log in to your own account and investigate the 2FA verification process. Notice that in the POST /login2 request, the verify parameter is used to determine which user's account is being accessed.
2. Log out of your account.
3. Send the GET /login2 request to Burp Repeater. Change the value of the verify parameter to carlos and send the request. This ensures that a temporary 2FA code is generated for Carlos.
4. Go to the login page and enter your username and password. Then, submit an invalid 2FA code.
5. Send the POST /login2 request to Burp Intruder.
6. In Burp Intruder, set the verify parameter to carlos and add a payload position to the mfa-code parameter. Brute-force the verification code.
7. Load the 302 response in the browser.
8. Click My account to solve the lab.

### Failing to handle unconventional input

 One aim of the application logic is to restrict user input to values that adhere to the business rules. For example, the application may be designed to accept arbitrary values of a certain data type, but the logic determines whether or not this value is acceptable from the perspective of the business. Many applications incorporate numeric limits into their logic. This might include limits designed to manage inventory, apply budgetary restrictions, trigger phases of the supply chain, and so on.

Let's take the simple example of an online shop. When ordering products, users typically specify the quantity that they want to order. Although any integer is theoretically a valid input, the business logic might prevent users from ordering more units than are currently in stock, for example.

To implement rules like this, developers need to anticipate all possible scenarios and incorporate ways to handle them into the application logic. In other words, they need to tell the application whether it should allow a given input and how it should react based on various conditions. If there is no explicit logic for handling a given case, this can lead to unexpected and potentially exploitable behavior.

For example, a numeric data type might accept negative values. Depending on the related functionality, it may not make sense for the business logic to allow this. However, if the application doesn't perform adequate server-side validation and reject this input, an attacker may be able to pass in a negative value and induce unwanted behavior.

Consider a funds transfer between two bank accounts. This functionality will almost certainly check whether the sender has sufficient funds before completing the transfer:

    $transferAmount = $_POST['amount'];
    $currentBalance = $user->getBalance();
    
    if ($transferAmount <= $currentBalance) {
        // Complete the transfer
    } else {
        // Block the transfer: insufficient funds
    }

But if the logic doesn't sufficiently prevent users from supplying a negative value in the amount parameter, this could be exploited by an attacker to both bypass the balance check and transfer funds in the "wrong" direction. If the attacker sent -$1000 to the victim's account, this might result in them receiving $1000 from the victim instead. The logic would always evaluate that -1000 is less than the current balance and approve the transfer.

Simple logic flaws like this can be devastating if they occur in the right functionality. They are also easy to miss during both development and testing, especially given that such inputs may be blocked by client-side controls on the web interface.

When auditing an application, you should use tools such as Burp Proxy and Repeater to try submitting unconventional values. In particular, try input in ranges that legitimate users are unlikely to ever enter. This includes exceptionally high or exceptionally low numeric inputs and abnormally long strings for text-based fields. You can even try unexpected data types. By observing the application's response, you should try and answer the following questions:
- Are there any limits that are imposed on the data?
- What happens when you reach those limits?
- Is any transformation or normalization being performed on your input?

This may expose weak input validation that allows you to manipulate the application in unusual ways. Keep in mind that if you find one form on the target website that fails to safely handle unconventional input, it's likely that other forms will have the same issues. 

**Example**. [Lab: High-level logic vulnerability](https://portswigger.net/web-security/logic-flaws/examples/lab-logic-flaws-high-level)

This lab doesn't adequately validate user input. You can exploit a logic flaw in its purchasing workflow to buy items for an unintended price. To solve the lab, buy a "Lightweight l33t leather jacket".
You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter 

**Answer**.

1. With Burp running, log in and add a cheap item to your cart.
2. In Burp, go to "Proxy" > "HTTP history" and study the corresponding HTTP messages. Notice that the quantity is determined by a parameter in the POST /cart request.
3. Go to the "Intercept" tab and turn on interception. Add another item to your cart and go to the intercepted POST /cart request in Burp.
4. Change the quantity parameter to an arbitrary integer, then forward any remaining requests. Observe that the quantity in the cart was successfully updated based on your input.
5. Repeat this process, but request a negative quantity this time. Check that this is successfully deducted from the cart quantity.
6. Request a suitable negative quantity to remove more units from the cart than it currently contains. Confirm that you have successfully forced the cart to contain a negative quantity of the product. Go to your cart and notice that the total price is now also a negative amount.
7. Add the leather jacket to your cart as normal. Add a suitable negative quantity of the another item to reduce the total price to less than your remaining store credit.
8. Place the order to solve the lab.

**Example**. [Lab: Low-level logic flaw](https://portswigger.net/web-security/logic-flaws/examples/lab-logic-flaws-low-level)

This lab doesn't adequately validate user input. You can exploit a logic flaw in its purchasing workflow to buy items for an unintended price. To solve the lab, buy a "Lightweight l33t leather jacket".
You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter.

Hint. You will need to use Burp Intruder (or Turbo Intruder) to solve this lab.
To make sure the price increases in predictable increments, we recommend configuring your attack to only send one request at a time. In Burp Intruder, you can do this from the resource pool settings using the Maximum concurrent requests option. 

**Answer**.

1. With Burp running, log in and attempt to buy the leather jacket. The order is rejected because you don't have enough store credit. In the proxy history, study the order process. Send the POST /cart request to Burp Repeater.
2. In Burp Repeater, notice that you can only add a 2-digit quantity with each request. Send the request to Burp Intruder.
3. Go to Intruder and set the quantity parameter to 99.
4. In the Payloads side panel, select the payload type Null payloads. Under Payload configuration, select Continue indefinitely. Start the attack.
5. While the attack is running, go to your cart. Keep refreshing the page every so often and monitor the total price. Eventually, notice that the price suddenly switches to a large negative integer and starts counting up towards 0. The price has exceeded the maximum value permitted for an integer in the back-end programming language (2,147,483,647). As a result, the value has looped back around to the minimum possible value (-2,147,483,648).
6. Clear your cart. In the next few steps, we'll try to add enough units so that the price loops back around and settles between $0 and the $100 of your remaining store credit. This is not mathematically possible using only the leather jacket. Note that the price of the jacket is stored in cents (133700).
7. Create the same Intruder attack again, but this time under Payload configuration, choose to generate exactly 323 payloads.
8. Click Resource pool to open the Resource pool tab. Add the attack to a resource pool with the Maximum concurrent requests set to 1. Start the attack.
9. When the Intruder attack finishes, go to the POST /cart request in Burp Repeater and send a single request for 47 jackets. The total price of the order should now be -$1221.96.
10. Use Burp Repeater to add a suitable quantity of another item to your cart so that the total falls between $0 and $100.
11. Place the order to solve the lab.

**Example**. [Lab: Inconsistent handling of exceptional input](https://portswigger.net/web-security/logic-flaws/examples/lab-logic-flaws-inconsistent-handling-of-exceptional-input)

This lab doesn't adequately validate user input. You can exploit a logic flaw in its account registration process to gain access to administrative functionality. To solve the lab, access the admin panel and delete the user carlos. 

Hint. You can use the link in the lab banner to access an email client connected to your own private mail server. The client will display all messages sent to @YOUR-EMAIL-ID.web-security-academy.net and any arbitrary subdomains. Your unique email ID is displayed in the email client. 

**Answer**.

1. While proxying traffic through Burp, open the lab and go to the "Target" > "Site map" tab. Right-click on the lab domain and select "Engagement tools" > "Discover content" to open the content discovery tool.
2. Click "Session is not running" to start the content discovery. After a short while, look at the "Site map" tab in the dialog. Notice that it discovered the path `/admin`.
3. Try to browse to `/admin`. Although you don't have access, an error message indicates that `DontWannaCry` users do.
4. Go to the account registration page. Notice the message telling DontWannaCry employees to use their company email address.
5. From the button in the lab banner, open the email client. Make a note of the unique ID in the domain name for your email server (`@YOUR-EMAIL-ID.web-security-academy.net`).
6. Go back to the lab and register with an exceptionally long email address in the format: `very-long-string@YOUR-EMAIL-ID.web-security-academy.net`. The `very-long-string` should be at least 200 characters long.
7. Go to the email client and notice that you have received a confirmation email. Click the link to complete the registration process.
8. Log in and go to the "My account" page. Notice that your email address has been truncated to 255 characters.
9. Log out and go back to the account registration page.
10. Register a new account with another long email address, but this time include `dontwannacry.com` as a subdomain in your email address as follows: `very-long-string@dontwannacry.com.YOUR-EMAIL-ID.web-security-academy.net`
Make sure that the `very-long-string` is the right number of characters so that the "m" at the end of `@dontwannacry.com` is character 255 exactly. something like `attackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattackerattack@dontwannacry.com`
11. Go to the email client and click the link in the confirmation email that you have received. Log in to your new account and notice that you now have access to the admin panel. The confirmation email was successfully sent to your email client, but the application server truncated the address associated with your account to 255 characters. As a result, you have been able to register with what appears to be a valid `@dontwannacry.com` address. You can confirm this from the "My account" page.
12. Go to the admin panel and delete `carlos` to solve the lab.

### Making flawed assumptions about user behavior
One of the most common root causes of logic vulnerabilities is making flawed assumptions about user behavior. This can lead to a wide range of issues where developers have not considered potentially dangerous scenarios that violate these assumptions. In this section, we'll provide some cautionary examples of common assumptions that should be avoided and demonstrate how they can lead to dangerous logic flaws.

#### Trusted users won't always remain trustworthy

Applications may appear to be secure because they implement seemingly robust measures to enforce the business rules. Unfortunately, some applications make the mistake of assuming that, having passed these strict controls initially, the user and their data can be trusted indefinitely. This can result in relatively lax enforcement of the same controls from that point on.

If business rules and security measures are not applied consistently throughout the application, this can lead to potentially dangerous loopholes that may be exploited by an attacker. 

**Example**. [Lab: Inconsistent security controls](https://portswigger.net/web-security/logic-flaws/examples/lab-logic-flaws-inconsistent-security-controls)

#### Users won't always supply mandatory input

One misconception is that users will always supply values for mandatory input fields. Browsers may prevent ordinary users from submitting a form without a required input, but as we know, attackers can tamper with parameters in transit. This even extends to removing parameters entirely.

This is a particular issue in cases where multiple functions are implemented within the same server-side script. In this case, the presence or absence of a particular parameter may determine which code is executed. Removing parameter values may allow an attacker to access code paths that are supposed to be out of reach.

When probing for logic flaws, you should try removing each parameter in turn and observing what effect this has on the response. You should make sure to:

- Only remove one parameter at a time to ensure all relevant code paths are reached.
- Try deleting the name of the parameter as well as the value. The server will typically handle both cases differently.
- Follow multi-stage processes through to completion. Sometimes tampering with a parameter in one step will have an effect on another step further along in the workflow.

This applies to both URL and POST parameters, but don't forget to check the cookies too. This simple process can reveal some bizarre application behavior that may be exploitable.

#### Users won't always follow the intended sequence

Many transactions rely on predefined workflows consisting of a sequence of steps. The web interface will typically guide users through this process, taking them to the next step of the workflow each time they complete the current one. However, attackers won't necessarily adhere to this intended sequence. Failing to account for this possibility can lead to dangerous flaws that may be relatively simple to exploit.

For example, many websites that implement two-factor authentication (2FA) require users to log in on one page before entering a verification code on a separate page. Assuming that users will always follow this process through to completion and, as a result, not verifying that they do, may allow attackers to bypass the 2FA step entirely. 

**Example**. [Lab: 2FA simple bypass](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/multi-factor/lab-2fa-simple-bypass)

??

**Answer**.

???


Making assumptions about the sequence of events can lead to a wide range of issues even within the same workflow or functionality. Using tools like Burp Proxy and Repeater, once an attacker has seen a request, they can replay it at will and use forced browsing to perform any interactions with the server in any order they want. This allows them to complete different actions while the application is in an unexpected state.

To identify these kinds of flaws, you should use forced browsing to submit requests in an unintended sequence. For example, you might skip certain steps, access a single step more than once, return to earlier steps, and so on. Take note of how different steps are accessed. Although you often just submit a GET or POST request to a specific URL, sometimes you can access steps by submitting different sets of parameters to the same URL. As with all logic flaws, try to identify what assumptions the developers have made and where the attack surface lies. You can then look for ways of violating these assumptions.

Note that this kind of testing will often cause exceptions because expected variables have null or uninitialized values. Arriving at a location in a partly defined or inconsistent state is also likely to cause the application to complain. In this case, be sure to pay close attention to any error messages or debug information that you encounter. These can be a valuable source of information disclosure, which can help you fine-tune your attack and understand key details about the back-end behavior.

## How to prevent business logic vulnerabilities

In short, the keys to preventing business logic vulnerabilities are to:
- Make sure developers and testers understand the domain that the application serves
- Avoid making implicit assumptions about user behavior or the behavior of other parts of the application

You should identify what assumptions you have made about the server-side state and implement the necessary logic to verify that these assumptions are met. This includes making sure that the value of any input is sensible before proceeding.

It is also important to make sure that both developers and testers are able to fully understand these assumptions and how the application is supposed to react in different scenarios. This can help the team to spot logic flaws as early as possible. To facilitate this, the development team should adhere to the following best practices wherever possible:
- Maintain clear design documents and data flows for all transactions and workflows, noting any assumptions that are made at each stage.
- Write code as clearly as possible. If it's difficult to understand what is supposed to happen, it will be difficult to spot any logic flaws. Ideally, well-written code shouldn't need documentation to understand it. In unavoidably complex cases, producing clear documentation is crucial to ensure that other developers and testers know what assumptions are being made and exactly what the expected behavior is.
- Note any references to other code that uses each component. Think about any side-effects of these dependencies if a malicious party were to manipulate them in an unusual way.

Due to the relatively unique nature of many logic flaws, it is easy to brush them off as a one-time mistake due to human error and move on. However, as we've demonstrated, these flaws are often the result of bad practices in the initial phases of building the application. Analyzing why a logic flaw existed in the first place, and how it was missed by the team, can help you to spot weaknesses in your processes. By making minor adjustments, you can increase the likelihood that similar flaws will be cut off at the source or caught earlier in the development process.
