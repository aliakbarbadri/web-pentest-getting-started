## [View all business logic vulnerabilities labs](https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-labs#business-logic-vulnerabilities)

In this section, we'll introduce the concept of business logic vulnerabilities and explain how they can arise due to flawed assumptions about user behavior. We'll discuss the potential impact of logic flaws and teach you how they can be exploited. You can also practice what you've learned using our interactive labs, which are based on real bugs that we've encountered in the wild. Finally, we'll provide some general best practices to help you prevent these kinds of logic flaws arising in your own applications.
